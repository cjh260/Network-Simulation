Put web applications to be run in the simulation here. A sample "counterApp" is provided. Any apps put in this directory will be initialized by the server on start up.

The format of the app must be similar to the provided one. The idea is to make things as flexible as possible for developers designing their own apps. At a bare minimum, their needs to be an app.js file in the main directory of the app that initializes it's own "express" object. Once imported into the simulation it becomes a sub app of the main app.
