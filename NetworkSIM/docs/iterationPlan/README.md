# Iteration Plans

## Iteration 4 Plan



### Front End Redesign

We plan on implementing a new design for the front end. Some GUI sketches have been made and pending on approval from the client, we will implement this design.

### View States

An attempt was made to make this work in iteration 3, however, it was not completed. A redesign is needed in the back end to make this work properly.

### RDTs

Currently RDTs are only able to import from the rdts folder within the server. Upon confirmation from the client, we shall make it so users can upload an RDT.

### Apps

Currently Apps are only able to import from the apps folder within the server. Upon confirmation from the client, we shall make it so users can upload an app. Currently apps are it's own express project essentially. They have its own app.js file, routes directory, views directory, etc. It is imported as a sub app of the main app and routes are added dynamically (at run time). This design decision was made by the group, but we need to confirm this with the client.

### Relationships between Apps, RDTs, and devices

We need to confirm with the client the how Apps, RDTs, and devices interact with each other.

### Other Considerations

Some redesigning of the code to make it more efficient, less error prone, more modular, naming uniformity, etc. 

Take into consideration any changes or redesigns from the client.
