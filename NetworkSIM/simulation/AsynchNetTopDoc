So Network topology in the transfer to mongo has become asynchronous, as such we must access the 
methods which access mongo via asynchronous function calls.

What does this mean?  This means that each net-top accessor method visible from the outside world (get device
and get iterable for both the device list and the network list) must be accessed through asynchronous methods.

This is done by using a callback function that does the behavior that is necessary.

For example if you want to iterate through the elements of device iterator:

net.deviceList.getIterator(function(devIt){
	do stuff on devit
	devit is the iterator for devices.
}
);

or

net.deviceList.getDevice(deviceName, function(device){
	do stuff to device;
}
);
